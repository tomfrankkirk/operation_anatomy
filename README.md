# Operation Anatomy

This is a prototype rails app that was developed to teach anatomy to medical students at the University of Oxford. Unfortunately the project never went ahead, so the app is unfinished. This repo contains only the framework (the actual teaching material is stored elsewhere) 

NB: there are some security issues in this repo due to outdated code and dependencies
